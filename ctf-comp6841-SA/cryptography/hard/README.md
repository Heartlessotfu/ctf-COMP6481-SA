For this challenge imagine you have intercepted some cipher text as well as a recipe that was transmitted with the cipher text.  You know that the message encrypted using a custom modified vigenere cipher after a bit of analysis. Find the key that was used to encrypt the message so that you can read all future messages that are exchanged. 

This key is the flag for this challenge and the key is not just a jumble of letters, it forms an english word. 



Good luck have fun :)  (Beware this is a very hard challenge)
