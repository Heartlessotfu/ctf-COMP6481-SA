The method used to encode this was a hybrid of a vigenere cipher and
a substitution cipher. Instead of your regular table that you 
would normally solve a vigenere cipher with, the alphabet has been changed to
be something other than abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. This new alphabet is
embedded within the recipe file. So that the table you usually associate with
the cipher has the shuffled alphabet on the top row and first column instead of 
the regular alphabet. 

After you obtain this, you can break the code and grab the key with the known
method of breaking vigenere ciphers.
