# New Zealand Kiwi Bread Recipe

Ingredients

- 6 - 7 Kiwis (medium ripe)

- 2 Grams of baking powder and baking soda

- 1 Xgg

- 1 1/2 Cups of flour

- Nine teaspoons of lemon juice

- Unpacked powdered sugar (1 cup)

*Measuring spoons are a must have

- Dark chocolate to your liking
- French salt (a pinch)
- One zest of a lemon
- Brown sugar packed (1 cup)
- Vegetable oil (1/2 cup)



Steps:

1. Zest the lemon that you have and set aside for later. 
2. Halve kiwis and place fruit, brown sugar and lemon peel and zest into a pan
3. Enrich the flavors by bringing the pan up to a boil
4. When the mixture has boiled, turn down the heat and keep stirring the mixture until all the fruit breaks down.
5. Just as the fruit breaks down, take the mixture off the heat. 
6. Let mixture cool to room temperature. 
7. Take your egg and oil and beat them together. Blend together flour, baking powder and salt. 
8. Add the baking soda to the cooked kiwi mixture and stir until bubbles form. Add this to the egg mixture and then add the flour mixture to it. 
9. You want the final combined mixture to be fully combined so stir gently until you can't see anymore dry ingredients. 
10. Pour fully combined mixture into a well greased loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes. Take the pan out of the oven and cool for 10 minutes before serving. 

Quickly eat the kiwi bread before it goes moldy in a week or so.
